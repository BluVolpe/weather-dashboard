# weather-dashboard

The user enters the name of a city in the search field, then clicks the search button. 
The app will display the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, and UV index.
Additionally, a 5-day forecast for that city is displayed below the current conditions showing similar information (predicted at 12:00 PM on each day).

Every time a user searches for a city, a button displaying that search information is created underneath the search field. 
When the user clicks on that button, a new search is executed for that location.
